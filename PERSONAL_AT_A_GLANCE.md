## From Then to Now: At a Glance

*_Journey starts at birth year 2000_*

- **PC & Console Gaming at 2:** Started understanding **_systems_**, **_game flow_** and **_controls_**. PlayStation 2, fat-backed CRT PC, Windows 98, **_FLOPPY DISK?!_**  
- **Team Sports at 5:** Played a **_team sport_** every year from 5/6 yrs. until 13 (2005–2013), in roles from **_pivotal captain-like_** to normal player positions (**_performance-based_**). Sports Played: Tee-Ball, American Soccer, Basketball, and Softball.  
- **Deeper Computer Exploration from 8–10:** One year into having a Windows 7 machine, started tinkering with **_cracking programs_**, making music/video CDs/DVDs, and getting **_familiar_** with modern Windows file types and protocols.  
- **GATE (Gifted and Talented Education) Acceptance at 9:** Opportunity to go to **_prep schools_** and **_GATE programs_**; declined due to lifestyle conflicts (e.g., school far away, single-parent household, work).  
- **Minecraft Server at 10:** Hosted a fully **_cracked server_**; experimented with **_plugins, administration_**, and **_basic network logic_**.  
- **Monetizing at 10:** Had **_donations set up_** with rewards for users. Early **_copywriting_** and **_software-selling_** skills brewing.  
- **COD YouTube Channel at 11:** Started a **_YouTube channel_** for popular games Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3, creating montages. ~50 subscribers.  
    - *_Partnered Minecraft YouTube channel at 12; ~550 subscribers; second channel (2014–15) had ~300 subscribers. Both channels’ videos had a 2:1 (Sub:View) view ratio avg._*  
    - *_~100 publicly produced and edited videos_*.  
    - *_Produced custom thumbnails using Cinema 4D & Photoshop since 2012_*.  
- **Streamed on Twitch at 11:** Streamed **_Minecraft_** on popular servers like "The Fridge," handling a **_live audience_**.  
- **Coding & System Admin Interest at 11:** **_Viewed code for HTML, CSS, and Java projects_**; used forums, documentation, YouTube tutorials, and peers to **_self-learn programming fundamentals_**.  
- **Freelancer at 13:** Made my first **_$150_** in 2013 doing **_config work_** for a Minecraft factions server. Did a lot of free and personal work in between freelancing until late 2018.  
- **Competitive Gaming Interest at 14:** Wrote **_e-sports documentation concepts_** for Minecraft PvP, before ESL tried with the popular network Badlion. Created **_custom ELO concepts and software_** based on ESEA's letter-grade system.  
- **Built My First Computer at 15:** Created a **_budget machine_** for recording game content, editing, rendering, work multitasking (**_coding + Chrome + 2 Minecraft's_**), and entertainment.  
- **Big Live-Production Project at 16:** 4th **_"in-charge"_** live production project including **_custom code_** and **_bare-metal servers_**. A project that took me from a **_humble plugin developer_** with config knowledge to a **_software engineer_** with real-world server **_security knowledge_**.  
- **Doordash & Pro Gaming Attempt at 18:** Coasted doing **_Doordash_** and trying to become a **_professional gamer_**.
- **Social Media Ad Creative (Video) Creation at 22:** Created **_custom creatives_** with a **_high click-through rate_**, experimenting with different AD metadata; e.g., varying text, song, clip pace, etc., per video.  
- **Social Media Marketing at 22:** Managed **_Facebook/TikTok Hot/Warm/Cold ad testing_**, audience narrowing/creation, and **_optimized ad settings_** (location, age, platform, interests, ad placement, timing, deployment schedule, pausing/deleting, copywriting) for **_cost effectiveness_**. Gained **_general marketing knowledge_**, e.g., knowing when a market won’t use a product due to cultural differences or needing to advertise in a different style.  
- **Learned Futures Trading (Crypto) at 23:** Recognized **_patterns to produce small returns on investment_**. Applied similar rules to **_normal stock trading_**.
- **Rebound to Programming at 25 (JAN 2025):** The only thing lacking on my return was **_raw syntax_**; all other aspects of work improved since I never stopped thinking about **_code/systems_**. **_AI tools_** only accelerated the relearning process instead of replacing it, since I originally learned to program **_without them_**.  

*_"It feels like I've been doing this forever."_ – Me, at some point*

## Early Projects: Intro to Minecraft Dev 101 (2010–2015)

*_All Minecraft server projects implemented monetization strategies with at least one purchase_*

- **It Starts Somewhere (2010–2012):** Ran a home-hosted **_cracked Minecraft server_** with ~10–15 concurrent active players.
- **First Network (2012–2013):** Attempted first network in the same year **_BungeeCord was released_**; first use of **_custom production code_**.
- **Collaboration Networks (2013–2015):** Published **_two collaborative networks_**, one with YouTubers, peaking at ~50 players/day with **_custom plugins and code_**.
- **Build Team Manager (2015):** Managed a **_build team_**; handled **_website, build server, advertisements, payments, and general management_**.
- **"Free"lancing (2013–2018):** Started **_freelancing_**, doing a generous amount of **_free and low-paying work_** for skill development and ambition. Personal projects were also attempted during this period.
- **Minecraft YouTube (2012–2015):** Created **_original content_**, managed production, made thumbnails using **_Photoshop & Cinema 4D_**, and built **_community engagement skills_**.
- **Freelancing & SYS Admin Work:** Started System Admin freelance work at 13, plugins at 14. Did a lot of free work due to ambition and needing experience.
- **Totals:** Solo published server(s)/networks: **_1 cracked server, 1 network_**. Collaborative networks published: **_2 networks_**. **_7 solo & collab concept networks with code_**. Production/commissioned code projects: **_20+ projects_**.

## Mid-Years: Skill Expansion & Reverse Engineering (2016–2018)

- **Multi-Project Network Ownership:** Progressed from **_plugin developer → Indie CTO_**. Reverse-engineered plugins, rebuilt/built old/new infrastructure, and maintained **_live production servers_**.
  - Created and/or maintained at least **_8 code projects_**, ranging from **_medium_** (core plugin, “Essentials” replacement) to **_large_** (single-server game instance with robust features).
- **DevOps & Security:** Managed and secured **_Linux boxes, Apache servers, custom web panels, game servers, TeamSpeak/Xenforo services_**.
- **Leadership:** Oversaw **_live production, revamps, and rebrands_**; reviewed staff candidates and coordinated **_multi-project operations_**. Taught and reviewed **_peer code_**.

## Hiatus: The Return (2019–2025)

*_General work (DoorDash driver / other gig apps) filled the missing time gaps_*

- **2019–2022:** Paused coding to pursue competitive gaming; achieved early regional **_semi-pro status_** for a short period.

- **2023:** Learned **_crypto futures trading_**.  
- **JAN 2025:** Returned to coding. The only thing lacking on my return was **_raw syntax_**; all other aspects of work improved since I never stopped thinking about **_code/systems_**. **_AI tools_** only accelerated the relearning process instead of replacing it, since I originally learned to program **_without them_**.
